# OSCAR Statistics

This is an experimental package to compute statistics on the OSCAR corpus releases. For the moment it only computes the statistics for a single snapshot that you have to specify as an argument. Computes the following statistics per language:

- Number of documents
- Number of tokens
- Number of bytes
- Number of characters

The output is a parquet file.
